# The Box Model

## Everything is a Box

- The box model is one of the fundamental concepts of CSS.
- When the browser renders an HTML element, it puts that in an invisible box.
- The box represents (or tells us about) the content area, padding, border and margin around the element.

## Box sizing

- By default all boxes are content box.
- That means the width and height of the element are applied to the content area.

## Block vs Inline elements

- Block level elements takes up the entire available width of the screen
- Whereas, inline elements takes up only the space it requires
- Make it an 'inline-block' and then it behaves like an inline element but also respects the width and height property.
